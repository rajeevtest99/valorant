# valorant - info

A cool app that showcases about the details of valorant.

## Packages used

- http - To call the Apis
- video player - To display the network videos in the weapons section
- :card_file_box: hive db - for caching the api data to reduce the server load
- awesome notifications - for sending local notifications for user engagement
- shimmer - an interactive loading package for cool looking loading indicators
- lottie - an another cool package for displaying animtions using lottie files

## My motto for this app

I wanted to explore more about flutter and other cool packages. Although we should not rely much on packages, I tried to minimize them as low as possible.
